CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN
This course has helped me understand the backend of how things run. I have mainly worked with frontend so this was a nice change and actually came to me pretty easily. This course has given me the ability to feel confident going forward into full stack 2 and I have honestly thought about becoming a full stack developer as a career path I enjoyed working with it that much.
